workspace = directory where you're developing

ROS links workspaces

the core workspace of ROS 2 is the "underlay"

local workspaces are called the "overlay"

setup files must be sourced in every new shell to 
	allows diff packages to be used across different distros

	source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash 
		or just add to bashrc: 
			$ echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
			$ source ~/.bashrc

#
# CREATING A NEW WORKSPACE
#

check ROS installation
	$ printenv | grep ROS

make a new ROS workspace (catkin)
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make

for python3 support, run this in a new ws
$ catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3

overlay new workspace
$ source devel/setup.bash

check if properly overlayed
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/youruser/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share

#
# FILESYSTEM
#

get the tutorials
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros-tutorials

filesystem concepts
package: unit of software in ROS, can contain libs/execs/scripts/etc.
manifest (package.xml): describes a package, including dependencies, version, maintainer, license, etc.

#rospack
find a ros package
$ rospack find [package_name]

#roscd
navigate to package dir
$ roscd roscpp
	NOTE: this can only find packages in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

$ echo ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
	can add dirs to path by separating with a colon

navigate to log directory
$ roscd log

#rosls
$ rosls roscpp_tutorials

#
# PACKAGES (catkin)
#

note: metapackage = package of packages

make up of a package
	must contain a compliant package.xml file
	a CMakeLists.txt
	must have its own folder

recommended to make a catkin workspace for a package
then use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new package 

E.g.  'beginner_tutorials' which depends on std_msgs, roscpp, and rospy:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp

next, must build the packages in the catkin ws

#review a package's 1st order dependencies
$ rospack depends1 beginner_tutorials 

#customizing the package

edit package.xml
	change description tag
	update maintainer with name and email
	 <maintainer email="user@todo.todo">user</maintainer>
	 license tags (rest of the ROS core uses BSD) 
	 license tags (rest of the ROS core uses BSD)
