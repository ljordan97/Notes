3 parts to a Git project:
	
	1) a working directory: manage files here

	2) staging area: where changes to working dir are listed

	3) repository: where Git logs ^changes as project versions


Workflow:

	a) edit files in wd

	b) add files to staging area

	c) save changes to repo (commit)


Create a new Git project:
				
	$ git init    //allows git cmds to be run in current dir
				  //creates hidden subdirectory .git


â€¦or create a new repository on the command line

	echo "# git_practice" >> README.md
	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git branch -M main
	git remote add origin https://github.com/ljordan97/git_practice.git
	git push -u origin main


Check status of Git project:
	
	$ git status //shows current branch, current commit, 
				 //untracked files, current added files


Add files to commit:
	
	$ git add filename 


Check changes to tracked file since last add:

	$ git diff filename //shows changes as green +'s 


Commiting files: 

	$ git commit -m "<= 50 char message in present tense about changes"


Refer back to old versions of project:

	$ git log    //shows 40 char code called SHA, IDs commit
				 //shows author, date, time, & message
